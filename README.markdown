## About

The PHP.sugar is bundled with Espresso. The source is maintained here, and is the best place to check up on development/get bleeding edge versions.

Always looking for suggestions and ideas for improving the sugar. Feel free to drop by the ##Espresso irc channel, or submit them at [derekr.lighthouseapp.com](http://derekr.lighthouseapp.com/projects/29033-phpsugar/overview).

## Features

* Syntax Highlighting (if we're missing something, let us know)
* Codesense for built-in PHP functions, global variables, magic variables (`__FILE__`)
* Classes, control blocks, function definitions, class properties and constants all show up in the code navigator
* Support for embedded languages
    * HTML (within php strings and outside of php blocks `<?php ... ?>`)
    * SQL (within php strings)

Thanks for [Nicholas](http://conceitedsoftware.com/) the PHP.sugar now offers

* Syntax checking (will check for basic syntax errors like missing semi-colons)
* Error-Log Console (need to set path to error-log file in the TextActions.xml file; defaults to MAMP's default location)
* PHP Reference lookup (via apple, google or php.net)

Thanks for checking it out! Hope you enjoy!
